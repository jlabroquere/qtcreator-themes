qtcreator-themes
========================

This repository contains themes for Qt Creator 2.6+. 
 
# Install

For mac, the theme xml file has to be placed under /Applications/Qt Creator.app/Contents/Resources/styles/
(right click to Qt Creator.app and choose "Show Package Content")

For linux, under :  ~/.config/Nokia/qtcreator/styles
Create the folder if needed.

After that, launch QtCreator and got to the "Tools/Options" or "Preferences" under mac then go to "Text Editor" and select the new theme ;)
